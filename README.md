Hi, I’m Pranay 👋

Java/J2EE full-stack engineer focused on building production-grade services and web apps with strong fundamentals in system design, testing, and delivery.

    I build Spring Boot microservices, design clean data models in MySQL, and ship responsive UIs with ReactJS.
    I take features from idea → API → UI → CI/CD → cloud deployment using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.
    I collaborate effectively in Agile/SAFe teams using Jira, with a bias for maintainability, performance, and clean architecture.
